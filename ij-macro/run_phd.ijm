// imagej macro for the neuron tree delineation using smc-phd
// processes given folder for .zip files (or any other extension) and apply the set of parameters  

// command example:
// java -Xmx4g -jar ~/ImageJ/ij.jar -ijpath ~/ImageJ/plugins/ -batch ~/test/run_phd.ijm ~/test/
// 
// java call, 4G ram
// ij.jar executable loading plugins from "~/ImageJ/plugins/"
// calls this very imagej macro "~/test/run_phd.ijm"  
// processes images from "~/test/"  directory (that's where the .tif or .tifs should be)

sigmas 		= "4,6"; // preprocessing tubularity measure scales, multi scale filteiring... [2,6] value combinations commonly
						// numbers correspond to the tube diameter, so 6 would filter out the  thicker tubes, 2 would extract the thin ones
						// possible to go multiscale and take max
						// sigmas are not comma separable, a new script with sigmas = "2" or "6" would need to be run

// (*) = possible to give multiple param values separated with commas to extend the parameter grid, no spaces in between, just commas
// use them on the same preprocessed image
th 			= "0.15"; 						// (*) local maxima tolerance: real values [0,1] range, correspond to tubulairity's byte image range [0,255] 
											// 		the same measure is used in IJ's Find Maxima... where it is 10 by deafult 			
											//    	10/255=0.039 would be ij's default, but tweaking this value is essential
											//      0.04 +/- k * 0.01 
											// 		very small value can cause seed overflow and long computation (no mechanism to reulate that at this moment)
											//		if the data are very clean then higher values make sense as the local maxima are more distinct

ni 			= "5";  					    // (*) number of particles predicted per particle  (typically 10,12   15 slows down very much), 5 works for well suppressed background
step 		= "3";  						// (*) prediction step (3 is reasonable, 2 can be used as well)
kappa 		= "3"; 							// (*) von mises circular variance used for the prediction, 3 is default
ps          = "0.95"; 						// (*) 0.95 survival pty, ok to set high, around 90%
pd 			= "0.95"; 						// (*) 0.95 detectio pty, ok to set high, around 90%
